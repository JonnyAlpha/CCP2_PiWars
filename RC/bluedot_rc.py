# The program below enables control of motors connected to a PiBorg ThunderBorg
# motor controller board using Martin O'Hanlon's BlueDot app (Andoroid version used for testing)
# Written using python 3
# To use the ThunderBorg you will need to download the Python 3 version of ThunderBorg3.py
# Install on Raspberry Pi using the following command:
# wget -O ThunderBorg3.py http://old.piborg.org/downloads/thunderborg/ThunderBorg3.py.txt
